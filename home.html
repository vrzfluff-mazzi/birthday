        🎀 Birthday Message for Tol 🎀

Happy Birthday, Tol! 🎂💖

Another year older, but somehow you just keep getting cuter—
especially with that hair that always looks effortlessly perfect
and those eyes that can steal attention without even trying. 👀✨
Not fair… but we’ll allow it 😌

You have this natural glow that makes people smile around you,
and a vibe that turns ordinary moments into fun ones.
Being around you feels easy, happy, and a little brighter—
like everything’s just better with Tol around 🌸

I hope this year brings you lots of laughs, sweet surprises,
and moments that make you think,
“Wow… life is actually really nice right now.”

Never stop being you—
because you do it very well.

Happy Birthday, Tol. 💕🌷
Enjoy every second—you deserve it 🎈 💕
